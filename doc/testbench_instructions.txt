The assembly files are stored in test/mips_assembly, with the file name as the name of the instruction being tested. 

If the same instruction is being tested twice, the second file name will have a number appended. 

The instruction column in the csv file should be the file name stripped of the letters, and the id should be the file name (without the extention obs)

The actual converted binary files are stored in test/mips_binary. However, the txt files with the actual assembly will still be used in the testbench as the last line contains a commented expected value of the result of the output from the simulator. This can be determined for writing pass or fail
