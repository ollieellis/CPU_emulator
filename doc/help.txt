ollie u should look up exceptions and error handling

registers in mips: http://www.cs.uwm.edu/classes/cs315/Bacon/Lecture/HTML/ch05s03.html

linked from the dude http://www.mrc.uidaho.edu/mrc/people/jff/digital/MIPSir.html - good summary of all functions 


from here  https://github.com/m8pple/arch2-2018-cw/issues/14  ->
